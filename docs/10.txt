The distance of a far away galaxy depends on what distance measurement you use.
With a redshift of 3.77, light from this active galaxy is estimated to have taken around 11.7 billion years to reach us.  But since this galaxy is receding from Earth at an estimated rate of 274,681\xa0km/s (the speed of light is 299,792\xa0km/s), the present (co-moving) distance to this galaxy is estimated to be around 22.7\xa0billion light-years (6947 Mpc).
