ESO 137-001
ESO 137-001 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Triangulum Australe and in the cluster Abell 3627. As the galaxy moves to the center of the cluster at 7 million kilometers per hour, it is stripped by hot gas, thus creating a 260,000 light-year long tail. This is called ram pressure stripping. The intergalactic gas in the Abell 3627 is 100 million degrees Celsius (180\xa0million degrees Fahrenheit) which causes star formation in the tails.
The galaxy was discovered by Dr. Ming Sun in 2005.
The stripping of gas is thought to have a significant effect on the galaxys development, removing cold gas from the galaxy, shutting down the formation of new stars in the galaxy, and changing the appearance of inner spiral arms and bulges because of the effects of star formation.[citation needed]
