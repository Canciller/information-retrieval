Field galaxy
A field galaxy is a galaxy that does not belong to a larger galaxy group or cluster and hence is gravitationally alone.
Roughly 80% of all galaxies located within 5\xa0Mpc (16\xa0Mly) of the Milky Way are in groups or clusters of galaxies. Most low-surface-brightness galaxies are field galaxies. The median Hubble-type of field galaxies is Sb, a type of spiral galaxy.
