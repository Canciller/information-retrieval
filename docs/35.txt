Flocculent spiral galaxy
A flocculent spiral galaxy is a type of spiral galaxy. Unlike the well-defined spiral architecture of a grand design spiral galaxy, flocculent (meaning fluffy) galaxies are patchy, with discontinuous spiral arms. Self-propagating star formation is the apparent explanation for the structure of flocculent spirals. Approximately 30% of spirals are flocculent, 10% are grand design, and the rest are referred to as multi-armed. The multiple-arm type is sometimes grouped into the flocculent category.
The prototypical flocculent spiral is NGC 2841.
