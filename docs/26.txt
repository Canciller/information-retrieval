Q0906+6930
Q0906+6930 was the most distant known blazar (redshift 5.47 / 12.2 billion light years) at the time of its discovery in July, 2004. The engine of the blazar is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) approximately 2 billion times the mass of the Sun (the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is around 1.5 trillion solar masses). The event horizon volume is on the order of 1,000 times that of the Solar System. It is one of the most massive black holes on record.
The distance of a far away galaxy depends on what distance measurement you use.  With a redshift of 5.47, light from this active galaxy is estimated to have taken around 12.3 billion light-years to reach us.  But since this galaxy is receding from Earth at an estimated rate of 285,803\xa0km/s (the speed of light is 299,792\xa0km/s), the present (co-moving) distance to this galaxy is estimated to be around 26 billion light-years (7961 Mpc).
