NGC 4656 and NGC 4657
NGC 4656/57 is a highly warped barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Canes Venatici and is sometimes informally called the Hockey Stick Galaxies or the Crowbar Galaxy. The galaxy is a member of the NGC 4631 Group. A Luminous Blue Variable in super-outburst was discovered in NGC 4656/57 on March 21, 2005.
This unusual shape is thought to be due to an interaction between NGC 4656, NGC 4631, and NGC 4627.
