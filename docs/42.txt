A1689-zD1
A1689-zD1 is a galaxy in the Virgo constellation cluster. It was a candidate for the most distant and therefore earliest-observed galaxy discovered as of February\xa02008[update], based on a photometric redshift.
If the redshift, z~7.6, is correct, it would explain why the galaxys faint light reaches us at infrared wavelengths. It could only be observed with Hubble Space Telescopes Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) and the Spitzer Space Telescopes Infrared Array Camera exploiting the natural phenomenon of gravitational lensing: the galaxy cluster Abell 1689, which lies between Earth and A1689-zD1, at a distance of 2.2 billion light-years from us, functions as a natural magnifying glass for the light from the far more distant galaxy which lies directly behind it, at 700 million years after the Big Bang, as seen from Earth.
