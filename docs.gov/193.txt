Today, Lisa O.
Monaco was sworn in as the 39th Deputy Attorney General (DAG) of the United States.
She returns to the Department of Justice where she first arrived as an intern 26 years ago, and went on to hold a variety of leadership roles at both the Department and the FBI.
DAG Monaco held a series of meetings with DOJ staff and received briefings on the January 6th Capitol Attack investigation and on national security.
In an all hands meeting with her immediate staff, DAG Monaco reiterated her commitment to reaffirming the Departments foundational mission and core values, pursuing the Constitutions promise of equal justice, and ensuring the safety of all who call America home.
Late in the day she sent an email to the DOJ workforce thanking them for their dedication, and conveying how honored she is to serve alongside them.
She is pictured here looking on as Attorney General Merrick Garland delivers remarks at her swearing in ceremony.
