Statement from Attorney General William P.
Barr on Cleveland Detective and Operation Legend Officer James Skernivitz who was Killed in Line of Duty
Attorney General William P.
Barr has issued the following statement:
Today is a very sad day for the city of Cleveland and the entire law enforcement community.
Overnight, Cleveland Division of Police Detective James Skernivitz was shot and killed in the line of duty.
Detective Skernivitz was a 22-year veteran of the Cleveland Division of Police and a sworn Operation Legend task force officer assigned to the Federal Bureau of Investigations Violent Crimes Task Force.
Two weeks ago, I had the honor of visiting the unit where Detective Skernivitz was assigned.
I was briefed on the critical work that he and his colleagues do to keep our streets safe from violent crime.
Detective Skernivitz selflessly gave his life in this cause.
It takes a special kind of courage to be a police officer.
Our men and women in blue put their lives on the line day after day in order to keep us safe.
We will not forget Detective Skernivitz and his life of service and sacrifice.
Isend my heartfelt condolences to his wife, children, and family.
