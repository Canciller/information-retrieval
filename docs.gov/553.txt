Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A.
Rosen Regarding the Overrunning of the USA Capitol Building
Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A.
Rosen issued the following statement:
The violence at our Nations Capitol Building is an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy.
From the outset, the Department of Justice has been working in close coordination with the Capitol Police and federal partners from the Interior Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Guard, as well as the Metropolitan Police and other local authorities.
Earlier this afternoon, the Department of Justice sent hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and agents from the FBI, ATF, and the USA Marshals Service to assist the Capitol Police in addressing this unacceptable situation, and we intend to enforce the laws of our land.
