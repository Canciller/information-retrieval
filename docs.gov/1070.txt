Operation Legend: Case of the Day
Indiana Man Charged with Firearm Offenses
Each weekday, the Department of Justice will highlight a case that has resulted from Operation Legend.
Todays case is out of the Northern District of Indiana.
While not a designated Legend district, the USA Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Indiana works closely with the USA Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois, which encompasses Chicago.
Operation Legend launched in Chicago on July 22, 2020, in response to the city facing increased homicide and non-fatal shooting rates.
Similarly, Legend was also launched in the Southern District of Indiana, which includes Indianapolis, on Aug.
14, 2020.
United States vs.
Darryl Ivery Jr.
This case demonstrates my offices commitment to partnering with our neighbors in Chicago to aggressively prosecute those who illegally supply guns to criminals in Indiana and Illinois, said Thomas L.
Kirsch II, USA Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana.
My office is committed to reducing gun violence, and the state line will not save criminals from federal investigations and prosecutions.

Darryl Ivery Jr.
was charged on Aug.
26, 2020, with making a material false statement in the acquisition of a firearm.
According to the charging document, during the course of an ATF investigation into straw purchasers, i.
e.
individuals who lie on ATF Form 4473 about their status as legal purchasers of firearms, Darry Ivery Jr.
became a person of interest based on a large number of firearms he had purchased, some of which had been recovered by law enforcement.
It is alleged that between Jan.
7, 2019, and Aug.
10, 2020, Ivery purchased a minimum of 26 firearms from Federal Firearm Licensed (FFL) gun dealers in Indiana.
Seven of the guns he purchased have been recovered by various law enforcement agencies, including six that were recovered in Chicago, Illinois, one of which was recovered at the scene of a shooting.
For each of the guns Ivery purchased, he answered, Yes on ATF Form 4473: Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form?
When interviewed by ATF Special Agents, it is alleged that Ivery admitted that with the exception of one of the firearms that he purchased, all of the others were bought for individuals who resided in Chicago who asked him to buy firearms for them.
They all paid Ivery in cash for every purchase he made.
Ivery purchased the following firearms:
