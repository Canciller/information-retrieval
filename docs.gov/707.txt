Montana Chiropractor and his Wife Plead Guilty to Tax Evasion
A Montana chiropractor and his wife pleaded guilty today to tax evasion, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E.
Zuckerman of the Department of Justices Tax Division and USA Attorney Kurt G.
Alme for the District of Montana.
According to court documents and statements made in court, Jonathan Wilhelm, owned and operated Pro Chiropractic PC (Pro Chiro) and Big Sky Spinal Care Center Inc.
(Big Sky).
From 2013 through 2018, the Wilhelms directed payments to cash and then did not report the cash transactions on Pro Chiros and Big Skys books and records, which they provided to a return preparer to prepare the businesses tax returns.
The Wilhelms knew that omitting the cashed checks and cash payments resulted in an understatement of taxable income totaling $284,691 for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018.
In total, the defendants caused a tax loss to the IRS of $74,486.
USA Magistrate Judge Kathleen L.
DeSoto has scheduled a sentencing for March 12, 2021.
At sentencing the defendants each face a maximum sentence of five years.
The defendants also each face a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and USA Attorney Alme commended special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant Chief Andrew Kameros and Trial Attorney Sarah Kiewlicz of the Tax Division, who are prosecuting the case.
