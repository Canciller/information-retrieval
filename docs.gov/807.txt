Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A.
Rosen issued the following statement:
Today marks the 20thAnniversary of the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.
This landmark law criminalized sex trafficking and forced labor, created systems to protect victims of this crime at home and around the world, and created prevention programs.
The Department of Justice was given sole authority to prosecute these new federal crimes.
It is important to look back at the coordinated effortsthat produced the TVPA  acollaborationof survivors, civil society advocates from faith-based groups and across the political spectrum, and policymakers.
That same spirit ofcollaborationwill allow the Department and its federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement partners to redouble its efforts in bringing the fight to human trafficking.
The PresidentsNational Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking, released last week, will help us reach our goal, which is nothing less than to end human trafficking once and for all.
