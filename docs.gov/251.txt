According to court documents and statements made in court, Lenore Worthy provided tax return preparation services in Temple Hills under several business names, including United Tax Services LLC.
For the tax years 2012 through 2018, Worthy and her co-conspirators fraudulently inflated client refunds by adding false deductions and business losses.

Worthy is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug.
20, 2021, and faces a maximum penalty of eight years in prison.
Worthy also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.
A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the USA Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Lenzner for the District of Maryland made the announcement.
