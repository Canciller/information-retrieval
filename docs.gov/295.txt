Owner of Plumbing Businesses Pleads Guilty to Employment Tax Fraud
Caused Tax Loss of More Than $550,000
A Montana businessman pleaded guilty today to employment tax fraud.
According to court documents, Thomas OConnell owned and operated three plumbing businesses, Quality Plumbing and Heating, Orbit Plumbing and Heating, and Orbit PHC, each based in Great Falls.
From at least 2005 through 2016, OConnell did not pay employment taxes for several quarters, despite being obligated to ensure such taxes were paid to the IRS.
Instead, he directed payments to other creditors and to his own personal expenses.
The total tax loss to the IRS from OConnells conduct is more than $550,000.
OConnell is scheduled to be sentenced on June 24, 2021, and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
He also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.
A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the USA Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
