Statement by Attorney General William P.
Barr on the Passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
Attorney General William P.
Barr has released the following statement:
On behalf of the Department of Justice, I extend my deepest sympathy on the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justice Ginsburg led one of the great lives in the history of American law.
She was a brilliant and successful litigator, an admired court of appeals judge, and a profoundly influential Supreme Court Justice.
For all her achievements in those roles, she will perhaps be remembered most for inspiring women in the legal profession and beyond.
She and I did not agree on every issue, but her legal ability, personal integrity, and determination were beyond doubt.
She leaves a towering legacy, and all who seek justice mourn her loss.
