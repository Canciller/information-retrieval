Arkansas RV Salesman Indicted for Income Tax Evasion
An indictment was unsealed today charging an Arkansas man with three counts of evading his individual income taxes.
According to the indictment, Joshua Wood, formerly a resident of Alma, Arkansas, was employed as a recreational vehicle and automobile salesman from 2014 through 2016.
Despite earning total gross income during these three years in excess of $300,000, Wood allegedly did not file his 2014 through 2016 income tax returns as required by law.
In addition Wood allegedly supplied his employers with forms W-4 falsely claiming he was exempt from federal income tax withholding.
When questioned by IRS Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) special agents about why he had failed to file his income tax returns, Wood allegedly gave a false statement.
If convicted, Wood faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count of tax evasion.
Each count also carries the possibility of a fine and supervised release upon completion of any sentence of incarceration.
A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the USA Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M.
Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Acting USA Attorney David Clay Fowlkes for the Western District of Arkansas made the announcement.
IRS-CI is investigating the case.
Trial Attorney Robert Kemins of the Justice Departments Tax Division is prosecuting the case.
An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
