According to court documents and statements made in court, between 2009 and 2017, Adrienne Williams owned and operated Ultimate Tax Service, a return preparation business, which had an office in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

Sentencing is scheduled before USA District Court Judge Terrence W.
Boyle.
At sentencing, Williams faces a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison.
She also faces a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties.
