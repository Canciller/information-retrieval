Former Correctional Officer Pleads Guilty to Role in Bribery and Drug Smuggling Conspiracy
A North Carolina man pleaded guilty today to smuggling drugs and other contraband into Caledonia Correctional Institution in exchange for bribe payments.
According to court documents, Kenneth Farr, 47, of Rocky Mount, worked as a correctional officer at Caledonia Correctional Institution, a state prison in Halifax County.
On at least six occasions in 2018, Farr used his position to smuggle contraband, including marijuana, tobacco, and what he believed to be oxycodone pills, to inmates in the prison.
In exchange for smuggling the contraband, Farr received payments ranging from $300 to $500 in cash or via a mobile application and pocketed at least $2,200 from inmates and their associates.
Farr pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to use a facility in interstate commerce in furtherance of unlawful activity.
He is scheduled to be sentenced in mid-June and faces a maximum of five years in prison.
A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the USA Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
