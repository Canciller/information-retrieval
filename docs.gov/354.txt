Escort Sentenced to Prison for Underreporting Income
A Florida man was sentenced today to 21 months in prison for filing a false tax return.
Jami Kopacz, of Fort Lauderdale, pleaded guilty to filing a false corporate tax return on Dec.
16, 2020.
According to court documents and statements made in court, Kopacz worked as a paid escort for clients across the United States.
Kopacz received payments directly from his escort clients, and from a private business for whom he worked as an independent contractor.
From 2015 to 2018, Kopacz used his corporation, JK Training LLC, to receive income, and then filed false corporate tax returns (Forms 1120S) that substantially underreported the companys gross receipts and total income.
The understatement on JK Trainings corporate tax returns was passed through to Kopaczs individual tax returns, which were also false as they underreported his total personal income.
Kopacz caused a total tax loss to the IRS of $278,325.
In addition to the term of imprisonment, USA District Court Judge Roy K.
Altman ordered Kopacz to pay $278,325 in restitution to the IRS.
Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M.
Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and USA Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida made the announcement.
IRS-Criminal Investigation investigated the case.
Trial Attorney Grace Albinson of the Tax Division and Assistant USA Attorney Christopher Browne of the Southern District of Florida prosecuted this case.
Additional information about the Tax Division and its enforcement efforts may be found on the divisions website.
