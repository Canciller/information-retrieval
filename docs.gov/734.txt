The indictment alleges all conspired to submit more than 80 fraudulent PPP loan applications by falsifying the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of the applicant businesses.
In support of these fraudulent loan applications, they conspired to submit, and did submit, fraudulent bank records and/or fake federal tax forms, according to the charges.
Some of the PPP loan applications were allegedly submitted on behalf of companies the defendants controlled.
Other loan applications were submitted on behalf of entities that third-parties allegedly owned, according to the indictment.
In exchange for these, several of the defendants received large kickbacks, according to the charges.
The indictment further alleges the defendants laundered a portion of the fraudulent proceeds by writing checks from companies that received PPP loans to fake employees.
Those that received checks included some of the defendants and their relatives, according to the charges.
The fake paychecks were then allegedly cashed at Fascare International Inc.

Some of items seized included a Porsche and a Lamborghini allegedly purchased with illegally obtained funds.
This is an ongoing investigation.
If the public has further information regarding this fraud, please contact the Department of Homeland Security at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.
In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.
PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.
The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
A federal criminal indictment is merely an accusation.
A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
This case was investigated by the SBA-OIG; HSI; FHFA-OIG; FDIC-OIG and TIGTA.
Trial Attorneys Louis Manzo and Della Sentilles of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section and Assistant USA Attorneys Rodolfo Ramirez and Kristine Rollinson for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case.
