Statement from Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B.
Wall on the Passing of Former Solicitor General Drew S.
Days III
Today, Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B.
Wall issued the following statement on the passing of former Solicitor General Drew S.
Days III:
We are saddened to learn of the passing yesterday of former Solicitor General Drew Days.
As Solicitor General from 1993 to 1996, Drew Days was a distinguished advocate for the United States before the Supreme Court, a wise leader for this office, and a cherished colleague.
His career outside the office was no less remarkable.
He was a trailblazing civil-rights litigator for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the respected head of the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division, and a beloved professor at Yale Law School for many decades.
His colleagues at the Solicitor Generals Office will remember Drew as a kind and gentle soul with a firm commitment to principle.
We offer our deepest condolences to his family and join the legal community in mourning his passing.
