San Antonio Return Preparer Pleads Guilty in Tax Fraud Scheme
A San Antonio, Texas, tax return preparer pleaded guilty today to aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E.
Zuckerman of the Department of Justices Tax Division and USA Attorney Gregg N.
Sofer of the Western District of Texas.
According to court documents and statements made in court, between 2013 and 2017, in San Antonio, Copperas Cove, and Killeen, Texas, Telesa Hall, 44, operated Precision Efile Tax Services, a tax preparation business.
During the course of the scheme, Hall prepared at least 51 fraudulent tax returns, which sought to generate inflated refunds for her clients.
Among other things, Hall falsely claimed on some of the returns substantial business losses, which artificially lowered her clients reported taxable income.
Sentencing is scheduled before USA District Court Jeffrey C.
Manske.
Hall faces a statutory maximum of three years in prison as well as a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and USA Attorney Sofer commended special agents or IRS-Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorneys William B.
Guappone and Francesca L.
Bartolomey, who are prosecuting the case.
Additional information about the Tax Division and its enforcement efforts may be found on the divisions website.
