Pennsylvania Marketer Pleads Guilty to Filing False Tax Returns
Falsely Inflated Business Expenses Caused More Than $100,000 in Tax Loss
A Bryn Mawr resident pleaded guilty today to filing false tax returns, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E.
Zuckerman of the Justice Departments Tax Division and USA Attorney William M.
McSwain for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
According to court documents and statements made in court, Jordan Richter sold marketing services and products, including email lists, to stock promoters.
From 2012 to 2014, Richter did business through Diamond Spot Media LLC, a partnership in which he was a 99.5 percent owner.
Richter inflated business expenses on Diamond Spots tax returns to reduce the partnerships reported income.
These falsities also resulted in Richter underreporting income on his personal returns for the years 2012 through 2014.
In total, Richter caused a tax loss to the IRS of over $100,000.
USA District Judge C.
Darnell Jones II, scheduled sentencing for March 8, 2021.
At sentencing, Richter faces a maximum sentence of three years for each count.
Richter also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and USA Attorney William M.
