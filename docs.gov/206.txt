Statement of Attorney General Merrick B.
Garland on the Verdict in the Chauvin Trial
USA Attorney General Merrick B.
Garlands statement following the verdict in the state of Minnesotas trial of Derek Chauvin:
The jury in the state trial of Derek Chauvin has fulfilled its civic duty and rendered a verdict convicting him on all counts.
While the states prosecution was successful, I know that nothing can fill the void that the loved ones of George Floyd have felt since his death.
The Justice Department has previously announced a federal civil rights investigation into the death of George Floyd.
This investigation is ongoing.
