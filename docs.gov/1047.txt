United States vs.
Antwan Bohanon
An Ohio man was charged on Aug.
13, 2020, in federal court in the Northern District of Ohio with illegally dealing in firearms without a federal firearms license.
This defendant is accused of dealing firearms in the city of Cleveland without a license, said USA Attorney Justin Herdman.
He went to great lengths to acquire, advertise and sell firearms to many people in the city of Cleveland, including those who are prohibited under federal law from purchasing or possessing a gun.
In fact, some of the firearms that the defendant allegedly sold later appeared in separate criminal cases.
Even just one gun in the hands of someone who should not be in possession of a firearm can have dire consequences.

According to court documents, Antwan Bohanon allegedly purchased multiple firearms outside of the city of Cleveland and later resold them inside of the city to various individuals, including some prohibited under federal law from purchasing or possessing a firearm.
Bohanon would often post images of his firearms for sale to his personal Instagram account at prices higher than market value.
According to the ATF affiant of the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, individuals who are unable to purchase firearms legitimately will frequently pay a much higher price to obtain one.
In addition, court documents show that some of the firearms Bohanon sold were later used in criminal activity.
