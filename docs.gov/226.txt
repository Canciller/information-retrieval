Tax Preparer Charged with Filing False Returns
A federal grand jury in Philadelphia returned a superseding indictment charging a Pennsylvania man with sixteen counts of assisting in the preparation of federal tax returns.
According to the superseding indictment, Jean Coq of Philadelphia prepared tax returns for clients for tax years 2013 and 2014 that claimed inflated itemized deductions, including unreimbursed employee expenses and gifts to charity.
As a result of these false items, Coqs clients sought tax refunds to which they were not entitled.
If convicted, Coq faces a maximum penalty of three years in prison on each count.
A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the USA Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M.
Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Acting USA Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania made the announcement.
The IRS-Criminal Investigations is investigating the case.
Trial Attorney Ann M.
Cherry of the Justice Departments Tax Division and Assistant USA Attorney David Ignall of the USA Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania are prosecuting the case.
An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
