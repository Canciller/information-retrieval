During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, HHS has taken steps to make it easier to provide telehealth services.
Telehealth  sometimes referred to as telemedicine  describes the use of 2-way communication technology for certain health care services.
We encourage health care providers to adopt and use telehealth as a way to safely provide care to your patients in appropriate situations, including: routine health care, like wellness visits; medication consultation; dermatology (skin care); eye exams; nutrition counseling; mental health counseling.

HIPAA flexibility during COVID-19
The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has issued guidance to empower health care providers to serve patients through telehealth during the national public health emergency.
HIPAA-covered health care providers may, in good faith, provide telehealth services to patients using remote communication technologies, such as commonly used apps  including FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Zoom, or Skype  for telehealth services, even if the application does not fully comply with HIPAA rules.
However, providers should not use any platforms that are public-facing  for instance, Facebook Live, Twitch, and TikTok  to provide telehealth.
