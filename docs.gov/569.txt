Statement by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A.
Rosen on the Pakistani Proceedings Relating to the Abduction and Murder of Daniel Pearl
Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A.
Rosen has released the following statement:
We understand that Pakistani authorities are taking steps to ensure that Omar Sheikh remains in custody while the Supreme Court appeal seeking to reinstate his conviction continues.
The separate judicial rulings reversing his conviction and ordering his release are an affront to terrorism victims everywhere.
We remain grateful for the Pakistani governments actions to appeal such rulings to ensure that he and his co-defendants are held accountable.
If, however, those efforts do not succeed, the United States stands ready to take custody of Omar Sheikh to stand trial here.
We cannot allow him to evade justice for his role in Daniel Pearls abduction and murder.
