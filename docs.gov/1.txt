A clean energy revolution is taking place across America, underscored by the steady expansion of the USA renewable energy sector.
The clean energy industry generates hundreds of billions in economic activity, and is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years.
There is tremendous economic opportunity for the countries that invent, manufacture and export clean energy technologies.
Responsible development of all of Americas rich energy resources -- including solar, wind, water, geothermal, bioenergy& nuclear --will help ensure Americas continued leadership in clean energy.
Moving forward, the Energy Department will continue to drive strategic investments in the transition to a cleaner, domestic and more secure energy future.
