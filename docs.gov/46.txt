Mask Up Toolkit
USA federal law requires the wearing of face masks on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation.
To get the message out to passengers about this new federal law, the USA Department of Transportation started the Mask Up initiative and developed a helpful FAQ page.
Weve also created materials to help industry and safety partners effectively communicate this mandate to the traveling public.
This toolkit includes background materials, talking points, digital assets, and print-ready resources to support your outreach efforts.
Each item is downloadable and shareable.
