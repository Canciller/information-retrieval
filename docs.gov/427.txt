North Carolina Return Preparer Sentenced to 50 Months in Prison for Multi-Year Tax Fraud Scheme
Attempted to Defraud IRS of More Than $3.5 Million
A Rocky Mount, North Carolina, tax return preparer was sentenced to 50 months in prison today for conspiring to defraud the United States, announced Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M.
Goldberg of the Justice Departments Tax Division and USA Attorney Robert J.
Higdon Jr.
for the Eastern District of North Carolina.
According to court documents and statements made in court, between 2009 and 2017, Adrienne Williams owned and operated Ultimate Tax Service, a return preparation business, which had an office in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.
During that time period, Williams and at least two of her employees at Ultimate Tax Service prepared false tax returns for clients.
The returns claimed fraudulent refunds by including, among other falsities, bogus federal income tax withholdings.
In all, Williams and her co-conspirators sought to defraud the IRS of more than $3.5 million.
In addition to the term of imprisonment, USA District Court Judge Terrence W.
Boyle ordered Williams to serve three years of supervised release and pay $4,830,723 in restitution to the IRS.
Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney Goldberg and USA Attorney Higdon commended special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Trial Attorney Michael L.
Jones of the Tax Division and Assistant USA Attorney Susan B.
Menzer, who are prosecuting the case.
