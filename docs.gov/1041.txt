Statement by Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B.
Wall on the Passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B.
Wall has released the following statement:
On behalf of the Office of the Solicitor General, we mourn the loss of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justice Ginsburg was rightly renowned among people of all backgrounds, but she has a special significance to Supreme Court lawyers.
She was herself a pathmarking advocate before the Court in landmark equal-protection cases in the 1970s.
And during her 40 years on the Supreme Court and D.
C.
Circuit, she was equally formidable from the other side of the lectern.
She was an incisive questioner, a clear and careful writer, and a model of dignity and civility.
In the process, Justice Ginsburg served as an inspiration to this office, the Supreme Court bar, and far beyond.
I extend our deepest condolences to her family, her colleagues on the Court, her former law clerks, and all who knew and admired her.
